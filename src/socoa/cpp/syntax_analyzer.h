@brief Analyses the syntax of every declaration token of a source code.

Analyses the syntax of a source code, by calling the operator() function.
After parsing the input, it generates a syntax tree of the source code and
returns it.
This class can analyze the source code of full programs only. See
generic_syntax_analyzer for an any token analysis.
